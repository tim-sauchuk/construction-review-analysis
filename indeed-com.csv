Field Engineer,Corporate structure,"the corporate structure at Suffolk was very rigid and regimented. Superintendents were overloaded with paperwork and reports, we spent more time filling out reports than running the job"
Cost Engineer,Cut throat and unsupportive,Very unsupportive culture and no room to explore other career paths. Management was very impatient and unwilling to properly help train and prepare those just starting their careers.
PE-APM,Great intentions to become a smart company.,"There is a lot of work and expect long hours every day. Many meetings and reports. You will work more than 60 hrs a week and include some Saturdays ( it is a construction company as any other one) you are allowed to report maximum 40 hrs every week regardless.Promises about bonuses, but projects are always loosing money.Respect on the PM side to certain point. (More than other construction companies)No effort recognition.Selfishness predomine among some teams.Manny people invest more time on making good relationships than getting a good professional result. Good benefits. 401k is partially vested.You end specializing on doing just one thing, poor development. Unless you have friends to help you go where you would like.Good company to get some experience and move forward."

Site Supervisor,Suffolk cares about their employees more than any other company I hve worked for,"John Fish, Owner of this privately held company, truly cares about his people.  We increase the size of our company by 25 - 30% annually so you would excuse the CEO if he doesn't know everybody by name - but every time I meet him he calls me by my first name.Every time Suffolk is changes some benefit, work schedule, holiday schedule it is for the better.  Examples are: we have half day Fridays for summer - they just became full day Fridays - and if you want to take it on any other day of the week instead - that's good too.  Benefits just changed - for the better! We just got an email this week telling us that we will be getting another day off for Christmas on top of what we already get.  A couple months ago we got another email saying that Suffolk is changing the vacation policy - BY GIVING AN EXTRA WEEK!A typical work day is 7:00 - 4:30 ish although nobody is watching I have learned a lot - the training is greatManagement gets it and they are supportive and experienced at what they are managingCo-workers are like-minded go-getters who DO NOT care what color your skin is (unlike the other person's experience I have previously read here - it has not been my experience)Hardest part of the job is keeping up with tight schedulesMost enjoyable part of the job is constructing amazing buildings with a fun group of real, non corporate type people - it feels like family here."

Project teams were well put together, offered ample training, had a good open door policy and most all paid well and offered good benefits.  There issue was getting around the ""good ole boy"" system.  While i was there, there wasn't one minority Lead/Senior Superintendent, not one!  If there is ever an issue with a sub-contractors, engineers or architects whether you're to blame or not, they will not stand beside you.

Everyone worked towards a goal of being the best in the industry.Due to the industry and state of the economy a reduction in workforce was common, and I handled this aspect of my job with professionalism and respect.Suffolk Construction Company was committed to its employees and leading edge technology. They strived to be a leader in the industry and provided heir employees the tools to be successful."
Project Administrator,Hard working Enviroment,I'm sure everyone has heard some negative connotations with Suffolk Construction but I am very pleased to say that the company has been a great environment to work in. John Fish is very passionate about construction but does a lot to give back. Working there you get a lot of great benefits and you get a lot of opportunities to give back by working with charities and attending fundraisers and such. The people are really great to work with and are very eager to help as a team. They also have a lot of things in place to help with work life balance such as health fairs and half days on Fridays in the summer.Everyone in construction knows its a tough industry and is more than the typical 9-5 but Suffolk tries their best to make it a fun and enjoyable place to be. It shows that they know everyone works hard and try to show the appreciation. I honesty love working there a lot more than I thought I would. It's a great overall career and would recommend it.
